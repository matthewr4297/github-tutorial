## Git vs. GitHub
* **What is the difference between Git and Github?**
## Git:
  * is a tool that can be used to help you manage past versions of your files. 
  * This is achieve by using backups [known as "snapshots" in git] of your previous code which can 
  saved locally to your computer. 
  ## GitHub:
  * is an actual website that you and I can access. 
  * It is a cloud based service which can be used to save your Git **repositories** [Aka files and folders]. 
  * These _repositories_ can be then be extracted to your own device with an internet connection. 
  * Additionally, you can also find other people's code that they have worked on through GitHub.
