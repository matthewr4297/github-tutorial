## Git vs. GitHub
* **What is the difference between Git and Github?**
## Git:
  * is a tool that can be used to help you manage past versions of your files. 
  * This is achieve by using backups [known as "snapshots" in git] of your previous code which can 
  saved locally to your computer. 
  ## GitHub:
  * is an actual website that you and I can access. 
  * It is a cloud based service which can be used to save your Git **repositories** [Aka files and folders]. 
  * These _repositories_ can be then be extracted to your own device with an internet connection. 
  * Additionally, you can also find other people's code that they have worked on through GitHub.

## Initial Setup
### _So, you wanna begin how to learn Git, huh?_
Before we even get started with Git, it is required to make a Github account;
  1. Go to github.com(Link)
  2. Navigate to _Sign In or Sign Up_ section on the top of the github website(screenshot1)
  3. Click _Sign Up_ and follow the instructions to create an github account
  4. Once done, navigate to the "settings" tab
  5. Find the tab that says "SSH and GPG keys"
  6. Click "New SSH key" and now you have an SSH key which can be connected to Cloud 9
* _After you have successfully verified your account and is now active, you must also create a **Cloud 9** account_ 
 1. Go to c9.io(Link)
 2. Navigate to the "Login for existing cloud9 customers"
 3. Go to the github icon(Which should look like this)(screenshot3)
 4. Log into your github account and follow the prompt to sign up for cloud 9

## Repository Setup
Once you have completed the 
### "Initial setup",
you have to create a repository. Which is able to create files, initilize and commits gits locally, and can also 
be used to upload repositories in your github account via an SSH key.
## _Setting up a cloud9 workspace_
* In the cloud9 main screen, click the + icon
* Name your workspace
* Then, just click "Create workspace" 
___
Once your repository is ready and you open it, you can now use the command line via the "bash" tab in your workspace

## Now youre able to use the command line for git commands!

## Workflow & Commands
Now that youre in your cloud 9 workspace, you can start learning the basic commands of not only git, but command line also!
---
Here are the most important git commands that you will use:

* **git status**: To check your current status for your git repositories 
* **git add file**: Adds files to your stage, but does not commit them
* **git commit -m "message"**: adds the files from the stage into a commit, which can be accessed at any time 
* **git push**: where you push your files into your selected github repository, and can now be accessed at anytime with an internet connection!

## Rolling Back Changes
* Undo edit: git checkout -- file
* Undo add:  git reset HEAD file
* Undo local commit: git reset --soft HEAD~1
* Undo commit stored on github: git rm --cached file
